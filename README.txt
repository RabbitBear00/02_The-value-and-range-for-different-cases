A self thought problem

#Define the problem
How to sort 8 possibilities in to n cases, each carrying (n1, n2, n3...) possibilities input by user

#IPO
Input: 
How many cases do you split? -- count
String of case num 1? -- case_name[0]
...(repeat for count times)
How many ppl do you want in each case? --case_count[0]
...(repeat for count times)

*should check the total of every element in case_count shouldnt exceed 8

Process:
1)Store inputs
2)Do some loops
3)sort
4)split into n cases
5)If condition(end of a array doesnt equals to start of a array) met, generate solution

Output:
With value value[0], value[1], value[2],
There will be case_count[0] people in case_name[0] with range...
